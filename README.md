# Pathfinding-Visualizer

Pathfiding Visualizer is my first Python project, so it isn't written in the best way. The code isn't very clean and the program isn't easily extensible. I plan to improve the code and rebuild the project in the future, but it won't be too soon.

This file includes the following chapters:
1. Code Requirements
2. Project description
3. How to install
4. Tips

# 1. Code Requirements:
Python 3.8 with following modules installed:
* Pygame 1.9

# 2. Project Description:
The project supports following algorithms:

<b> BFS </b> runs on <b> unweighted </b> graphs with <b> O(|V|+|E|) </b> complexity. Guarantees the shortest (unweighted) path.

<b> DFS </b> runs on <b> unweighted </b> graphs with <b> O(|V|+|E|) </b> complexity. Doesn't find the shortest path.

<b> BFS </b> runs on <b> unweighted </b> graphs with <b> O(|V|+|E|) </b> complexity. Guarantees the shortest (unweighted) path.

# 3. How to install:
If you're familiar with git you can clone the repo. Otherwise you can simply download whole project as a compressed folder.

Then you need to make sure your device meets the requirements in chapter 1 (appropriate libraries installed).
You can install them with pip from the command line.

Finally run the program using command line. Navigate to the directory, where the project is located and type python main.py

Wait a few second...
And you should see sth like that:
(comming soon!)

# 4. Tips:
Comming soon! (or rather after the next update, so not soon)
